1. Introduction
This project is designed to provide a robust and scalable container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications in containers. Kubernetes aims to facilitate the efficient management of containerized applications across clusters of hosts, providing container-centric infrastructure.

2. General Characteristics
Key Features:

Automated Deployment: Simplifies application deployment and scaling.
Service Discovery and Load Balancing: Automatically exposes containers to the internet and distributes traffic.
Storage Orchestration: Automatically mounts the storage system of your choice, such as local storage, public cloud providers, and more.
Technology Stack:

Language: Go (Golang)
Framework: Kubernetes API
Database: etcd (a distributed key-value store for configuration data)
Target Audience:

Developers and DevOps engineers looking to deploy and manage applications using containerization technologies, specifically Docker. Also, organizations seeking to implement microservices architectures.
